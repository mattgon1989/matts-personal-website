          <p>Have a strong passion in music I play guitar from time to time in what time I have free I use to play a lot of music in high school and for a bit when i was more serious about it, use to tour in local small areas and meet lots of people. I enjoy a lot of music in general I go to shows every now and then or just listen when im winding down or just to get some inspiration and ideas.</p>

          <p>Always had a interest and love for movies and everything to do with them, I have done acting when I was young and have always enjoyed the art of it. I studied acting for a couple years to learn the craft of acting and how much work, focus, and dicipline that goes into it was a very intense class and has helped me to be a better actor and overall a better communicator i general I still from time to time use the excercises that I was taught to keep on top of things or when I watch movies or live shows </p>

          <p>Growing up with video games has to be one of the reasons why I want to learn more about computer programming/ software development, I always find myself wanting to know more of how things work and how it all comes together. I find myself saying maybe one day I will make a fun project of my own something for myself that is fun just to get some experience dont matter if its big or small</p>
